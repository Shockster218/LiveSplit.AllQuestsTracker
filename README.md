# Livesplit.SummaryTracker
 A livesplit component to track all summary stats for The Hobbit.
 
   <h3>Notice!</h3>
<b>If you have the older version called "LiveSplit.AllQuestsTracker.dll" make sure to completely remove the component from livesplit and then save your layout with the component before installing "LiveSplit.SummaryTracker.dll"! Failing to do so will make your layout unusable!</b>

   <h2>Installation</h2>
 1. Go to <a href="https://github.com/Shockster218/LiveSplit.SummaryTracker/releases">releases page</a> and download the latest LiveSplit.SummaryTracker.dll release.</br>
 2. Navigate to the folder where you have livesplit installed, then components folder and drop the downloaded file in there.</br>
 3. Go to livesplit. Right click the window and then click edit layout. On the left, click the + button, find the control option, and then add The Hobbit - Summary Tracker component from there.</br>
 4. Go into the settings of the component and be sure to set a username in the username field!</br>
 5. You're all done!

 It's also highly recommend to use this in conjunction with the All-In-One Autosplitter I made for the hobbit found <a href="https://github.com/Shockster218/Hobbit-PC-Autosplitter">here</a>.
